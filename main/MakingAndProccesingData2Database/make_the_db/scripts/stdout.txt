***RibDif running on Ruegeria***


Downloading all strains of Ruegeria into Ruegeria/refseq/bacteria/ with ncbi-genome-download.

	9 genomes downloaded.


Gunzipping all files.


Renaming fastas and adding GCF (for genomes with multiple chromosomes).


Finding all rRNA genes longer than 90% of expected length with barrnap.


Fishing out 16S genes.


Renaming 16S headers.


Splitting 16S.


Skipping detailed intra-genomic analysis and ANI (if needed, use -a/--ANI).


Alligning full-length 16S genes within genomes with muscle and building trees with fastree.


Summarizing data into Ruegeria/Ruegeria-summary.csv.


Skipping alignments and trees (if needed, use -m/--msa).



Running amplicon analysis with default primers.


-------------------------------------

Working on v3v4-primers:


Making amplicons with in_silico_pcr.


Skipping alignments and trees (if needed, use -m/--msa).


Making unique clusters with vsearch.


Making amplicon cluster membership heatmaps.


Summary:

Genomes: 9
	Named: 3
	Non-named: 6

Named species: 2

1 of 9 (11.11%) genomes have multiple alleles.

0 of 2 (0%) species have at least one overlap.

No species overlap.
